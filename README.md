# Severe-Pediatric-Community-Acquired-Pneumonia-Prediction

This repository contains the code and model for predicting severe pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) using a multimodal fusion of chest X-ray images and clinical data. The developed model integrates pediatric chest X-rays, laboratory test results, and demographic data to provide an early prediction of severe CAP, which is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality in children.

Our approach involves the optimization of key hyperparameters, including model architecture, initialization parameters, loss function weighting, and down-sampling strategies. By employing multimodal fusion techniques, we significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to unimodal models.

The model achieved an ROC-AUC of 92.91 ± 0.64% and a PR-AUC of 46.68 ± 4.50% in predicting severe CAP in a cohort of 3,964 pediatric patients. This work represents a promising step toward the application of artificial intelligence in pediatric health, specifically in the early detection of critical diseases.
